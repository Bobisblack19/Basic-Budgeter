# Basic-Budgeter
I'm working on my OOP with a basic Budgeting program.

THe goal is to have it 

1. ask you for your overall budget on start up
2. break that budget down into food and entertainment (though in a more advanced model you;d set the parameters)
3. allow you add items according and deduct them from the budget balances
4. return you your remaning balance
5. cue itself up for more additions if you so choose

A more advanced model will include

  1. Projections of income/spending based on month over month analysis
  2. Spending breakdowns
  3. the ability to transfer funds between budget categories
